# ConvexOptimization

This repository is created for the convex optimization projects. The repo contains a main file and a
python file with all functions. 

The programs are tested to run under:
Windows 10 64bit
Python 3.5 64bit

The program implements two functions:
- vanila function using gradient descent to solve minmax saddle point
- dual averaging method for saddle point
